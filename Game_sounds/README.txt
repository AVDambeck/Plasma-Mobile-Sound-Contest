Made in LMMS. Audacity used to organize, clip and normalize audio.

Key1 through Key5 are varations on the same key sound. They're tuned to a pentatonic scale and are supposed to be arcade sounding, and maybe a little on the annoying side. 

Modifer is for shift or other modifier keys.

Noto1 and Noto2 are notification sounds in the same stlye as the key clicks
